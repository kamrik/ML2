## Home assignment 3 - Help Navigate Robots
 - **Important:** this is a live Kaggle competition with a deadline to join it - **You must join by April 4th**. Submission deadline is April 11. Note that **deadlines are in UTC time**.
 - Read the instructions on the competition website https://www.kaggle.com/c/career-con-2019
 - This competition is part of [Kaggle CareerCon 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/careercon2019)
 - You can make up to 5 submissions per day (count resets at midnight UTC), therefore in order to iterate on your solution efficiently you must set up your own validation procedure.
 - Note that in this competition the test data distribution differs significantly from the training data. Your Leaderboard scores are likely to be 10-20 percent points below your own validation scores, but the correlation is still good.
 - The score is classification accuracy 0.6 means 60% of series classified correctly.
 - To get a passing grade, you must have a submission on the Leaderboard with a score of 0.3 or above (which can be done by throwing all the data into a simple dense network). 
 - Higher score will get you a better grade
   - 100 if you make it into the top 100 on the Leaderboard
   - 96 for 0.5 or better
   - 60 for 0.3
   - Scaled linearly between 0.3 and 0.5
   - 10 for a valid submission with score below 0.3
 - Some starting points:
